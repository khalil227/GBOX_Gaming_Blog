               <p>Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may have popularised the last player standing format, but Fall Guys: Ultimate
               Knockout has truly unlocked its potential by painting it hot pink and putting it in a hot dog costume. Mediatonic’s
               family-friendly formula is a colourful, bouncy breath of fresh air that takes a different, less explosive approach to
               battle royales without losing any of the tension. Instead of C4, it’s Vitamin C you’ll be steering clear of as you’re
               bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges in just one of its two dozen game show-like events. The vast majority of
               these minigames hit the mark, offering fun and frustration in equal amounts. Couple them with a vibrant aesthetic and a
               brain-tunneling soundtrack and Fall Guys manages to make you want to punch the air when you’re winning and scream at
               your screen when you’re losing, but you’ll be laughing either way.</p>

               <P>The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide
               your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at
               taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home
               that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate
               obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you
               into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it
               out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears.</P>

               <img src="../photo/Fall-Gys2.png" alt="">

               <p>That said, there are no offline modes in Fall Guys currently, so that mastery only came out of a lot of online losses.
               There’s no practice area to get to grips with the two dozen events, but more crucially there isn’t any scope for local
               co-op. It feels a bit of a miss to not have the option to play split-screen or against the AI in your own private
               matches. Most of the fun I’ve had with Fall Guys has been when playing with friends, whether that be cheering them on
               once I’ve already been eliminated or laughing at them as they get hurled into the abyss thanks to a 20-foot long banana.
               What’s a party game without a healthy dose of schadenfreude, after all?"</p> <br>
