    <div class="PlayStation">If you’re learning how to build a PC and making your very first attempt at putting one together, it may seem daunting. However, it’s actually not as hard as you would think. You just need to be thoughtful when picking the correct PC components and placing them in the proper slots and with the right connectors. In fact, it’s an exciting time to attempt your first build.

    </div>
    <div class="PlayStation2">It’s OK if you’re not sure where to begin. We’ve spent plenty of time putting together computers over the years and are here to share our expertise with you on how to build a PC. We’ll guide you through the whole process, step-by-step, to make something special out of all those components you’ve spent your hard-earned cash on. Before you know it, you’ll not only own one of the best PCs out there but one that’s unique because you built it yourself.

    <div class="PlayStation3">Although a single phillips screwdriver is all you need to construct a PC, you may want a few more things on hand just in case. For example, needle nose pliers or a simple pair of tweezers may come in handy to place screws into tight places or retrieve them. 

      Zip ties are useful for tidying up all your PC cables and luckily, you most likely won’t have to buy them as they often come included with several different types of computer parts. You’ll also need a pair of side cutters (or just scissors) to cut those said zip ties.
      
      You can’t go wrong with an anti-static wrist strap, either – though you can get away with not having one. Unless you’ve been running around on carpet all day, or have cats, you likely aren’t holding enough static charge to damage the electronics. Just do yourself a favor and discharge any latent electricity by placing your hand on metal, like your PC case or power supply.<br><br>
      As for your workspace, you’re going to want to clear off a good bit of table space, as you'll likely be flipping your PC on its side, feet, back and any which way to install everything. 

      And, before we forget, it’s a good idea to get a monitor, keyboard and mouse set up before you start building, so you have something to plug it into when the building is done. You should also have a power socket and internet connection available.
      
      It’s hard to find a modern build <br>
      </div>
      <div class="suite">with an optical drive these days, so put the Windows 10 installer onto a USB stick (we’ll show you how). If you can’t find a handy thumb drive and a laptop, we would cannibalize an older rig for a CD drive, or even just buy one – you can find them online for less than 10 bucks these days.<br>
        It’s time, to build. Finally.

        After spending weeks coming up with a list of PC components, waiting anxiously for them to go on sale, and getting them delivered to your door, it’s time. You’ve got a phillips head screwdriver in hand, and you’re ready to go.
        
        Now for the purposes of our PC building guide, we’ve used these following parts as an example of how to build a complete computer. These components are also exactly what you need to construct an modest – if a little last generation – gaming PC.
